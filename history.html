                                    <p><span><a href="system.html">The Solar System</a></span> formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>As the pre-solar nebula collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion km; 19 billion mi) and a hot, dense protostar at the center. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early <a href="system.html">Solar System</a>, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.</p>

                                <p><span>Due to their higher boiling points</span>, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner <a href="system.html">Solar System</a> close to <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a> (within the frost line). They would eventually form the rocky planets of <a href="planets.html#mercury">Mercury</a>, <a href="planets.html#venus">Venus</a>, <a href="planets.html#earth">Earth</a>, and <a href="planets.html#mars">Mars</a>. Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The giant planets (<a href="">Jupiter</a>, <a href="planets.html#saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="">Uranus</a>, and <a href="planets.html#neptune">Neptune</a>) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of <a href="planets.html#mars">Mars</a> and <a href="planets.html#jupiter">Jupiter</a> where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements.</p>

                                <p>Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion. As helium accumulates at its core <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a> is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today. The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a> became a main-sequence star.</p>

                                <p><span>The main-sequence phase</span>, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a> compared to around two billion years for all other subsequent phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.</p>

                                <p><a href="system.html">The Solar System</a> will remain roughly as it is known today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At that time, the core of <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a> will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output will be greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be cooler (2,600 K (2,330 °C; 4,220 °F) at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable (possibly destroying it as well). Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. <a href="sun.html">The Sun</a> is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of <a href="">Earth</a>. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.</p>
