                                <span>The planets</span> and other large objects in orbit around <a href="sun.html">the Sun
                                </a> lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. Smaller icy objects such
                                as comets frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane.Most of the
                                planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by
                                natural satellites called moons. Many of the largest natural satellites are in
                                synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent. The four
                                giant planets have planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in
                                unison.

                                As a result of the formation of the Solar System, planets and most other objects orbit
                                the Sun in the same direction that <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a> is rotating. That is,
                                counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole. There are exceptions, such
                                as Halley's Comet. Most of the larger moons orbit their planets in prograde direction,
                                matching the planetary rotation; <a href="planets.html#neptune">Neptune</a>'s moon Triton is the largest to
                                orbit in the opposite, retrograde manner.Most larger objects rotate around their own
                                axes in the prograde direction relative to their orbit, though the rotation of <a
                                    href="planets.html#venus">Venus</a> is retrograde.

                                <span>To a good first approximation</span>, Kepler's laws of planetary motion describe
                                the orbits of objects around <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a>. These laws stipulate that each
                                object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus, which causes the body's
                                distance from the Sun to vary over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to
                                the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called
                                its aphelion. With the exception of Mercury, the orbits of the planets are nearly
                                circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical
                                orbits. Kepler's laws only account for the influence of the Sun's gravity upon an
                                orbiting body, not the gravitational pulls of different bodies upon each other. On a
                                human time scale, these additional perturbations can be accounted for using numerical
                                models, but the planetary system can change chaotically over billions of years.

                                distance from the Earth to the Sun if the planet's orbit were perfectly circular. For
                                comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km; 400,000 mi). Thus, <a

                                71,000 km (0.00047 AU; 44,000 mi), whereas the most distant planet, <a

                                With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a>, the
                                larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearest object to the
                                Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury,
                                whereas <a href="planets.html#saturn">Saturn </a>is 4.3 AU out from <a href="">Jupiter</a>, and <a

                                made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances, like the Titius–Bode
                                law and Johannes Kepler's model based on the Platonic solids, but ongoing discoveries
                                have invalidated these hypotheses.

                                <span>Some Solar System models</span> attempt to convey the relative scales involved in
                                the Solar System in human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanical—called
                                orreries)—whereas others extend across cities or regional areas. The largest such
                                scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the 110-metre (361 ft) Avicii Arena in
                                Stockholm as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, <a href="planets.html#jupiter">Jupiter </a> is a
                                7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, 40 km (25 mi) away, whereas the
                                farthest current object, Sedna, is a 10 cm (4 in) sphere in Luleå, 912 km (567 mi) away.

                                If the Sun–Neptune distance is scaled to 100 metres (330 ft), then the Sun would be
                                about 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the
                                giant planets would be all smaller than about 3 mm (0.12 in), and Earth's diameter along
                                with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3 mm or 0.012
