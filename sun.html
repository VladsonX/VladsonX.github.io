                                    component. Its large mass
                                    (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the <a href="">

                                    </a>, produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain
                                    nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This releases an enormous amount of energy,
                                    mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible
                                    light.</p>

                                <p>Because the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium at its core, it is a main-sequence star.

                                    specifically, it is a G2-type main-sequence star, where the type designation refers
                                    to
                                    its effective temperature. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous but shorter
                                    lived. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and
                                    that
                                    of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas
                                    substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up about 75% of the

                                26,660 light-years. From <a href="">Earth</a>, it is on average 1 AU (1.496×108 km) or
                                about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi; 4.64 ls),
                                109 times that of <a href="">Earth</a> or 4 lunar distances. Its mass is about 330,000
                                times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the <a href="">Solar
                                    System</a>. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%);
                                the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements,
                                including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in
                                the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. This energy, which can take
                                between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light
                                and heat. Far in the future, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the
                                point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a
                                marked increase in density and temperature which will push its outer layers to expand,
                                eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large
                                enough to render <a href="">Earth</a> uninhabitable approximately five billion years
                                from the present. After this, the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type
                                of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow
                                and give off heat from its previous fusion for trillions of years. After that it is
                                theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off no more energy. </p>

                                radius. It has a density of up to 150 g/cm3 (about 150 times the density of water) and a
                                temperature of close to 15.7 million Kelvin (K). By contrast, the Sun's surface
                                temperature is approximately 5800 K. Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors a
                                faster rotation rate in the core than in the radiative zone above. Through most of the
                                Sun's life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through the
                                proton–proton chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium. Currently, only 0.8% of
                                the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called
                                the CNO cycle, though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older
                                and more luminous.</p>

                                by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely. The remainder of the Sun is
                                heated by this energy as it is transferred outwards through many successive layers,
                                finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation (photons)
                                or advection (massive particles).</p>

                                From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the primary means of
                                energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins
                                with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient is less than the value
                                of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the
                                transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions
                                of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being
                                reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 000 kg/m3 to 200
                                kg/m3) between 0.25 solar radii and 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.</p>

                            <p><span>The Sun's</span> convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000 km) to near
                                the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense or hot enough to transfer the
                                heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is
                                low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward
                                towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands,
                                thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of
                                the mass develops into thermal cells that carry most of the heat outward to the Sun's
                                photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the
                                photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection
                                zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective
                                cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K (350-fold)
                                and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level, and 1
                                millionth that of the inner layer of the convective zone).</p>

                            <p>The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun
                                giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and
                                supergranulation at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar
                                interior sustains "small-scale" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.
                                The Sun's thermal columns are Bénard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal

                            <p><span>The visible surface</span> of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which
                                the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun
                                through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight.
                                The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible
                                light easily. Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with
                                hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than
                                air on <a href="">Earth</a>. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than
                                the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or
                                limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening. The spectrum of
                                sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at 5,777 K (5,504 °C;
                                9,939 °F), interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the
                                photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023 m−3 (about 0.37% of the
                                particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The photosphere is not
                                fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen
                                in atomic form.</p>

                            <p><span>The Sun's</span> atmosphere is composed of four parts: the photosphere (visible

                                water, which can be detected via their absorption spectra. The chromosphere, transition
                                region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun. The reason is not well
                                understood, but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the

                                a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high
                                in the sky. The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum
                                when viewed from space. When the Sun is very low in the sky, atmospheric scattering
                                renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta, and in rare occasions even green or
                                blue. Despite its typical whiteness (white sunrays, white ambient light, white
                                illumination of the Moon, etc.), some cultures mentally picture the Sun as yellow and
                                some even red; the reasons for this are cultural and exact ones are the subject of
                                debate. The Sun is a G2V star, with G2 indicating its surface temperature of
                                approximately 5,778 K (5,505 °C; 9,941 °F), and V that it, like most stars, is a

                            <p>The solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is
                                directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1,368 W/m2
                                (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that
                                is, at or near Earth's orbit). Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's
                                atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to 1,000 W/m2) in clear
                                conditions when the Sun is near the zenith. Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is
                                composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10%
                                ultraviolet light. The atmosphere in particular filters out over 70% of solar
                                ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths. Solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes
                                Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting ionosphere</p>
